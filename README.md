# searchengine_homepage
Web Dev project to mimic the homepage of a search engine.

Update November 11, 2020.  
Did too much to list out individually.  Tried to mimic the duckduckgo desktop page as much as possile.  Mostly based on aesthestics and not function.  The searchbar is obviously not ideal, I wanted to focus on more features rather than one, even though it is a focal point.  The spacing was done mostly with flexbox and flex properties.  The 3 text boxes at the bottom do not dynamically resort themselves into a column like the real website, I decided not to spend too long trying to accomplish that.  They do size and space horizontally in a similar way though, when the browser is stretched.  

The main thing I may return to fix is the searchbar, but I am pleased with this for my first CSS project.  
End Update.
